# jsoxente

A JavaScript interpreter for the "Oxente" scripting language.

This project is a personal study of interpreter architecture. Its structure and implementation are based on the concepts presented in the first interpreter, `jlox`, from Robert Nystrom's book, "Crafting Interpreters".

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **In Development...** ðŸš§

For now we have:

  * A **Scanner (Lexer)** that breaks the source code into a stream of tokens.
  * A **Parser** that consumes these tokens and builds an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, correctly handling operator precedence and associativity for all expressions.
  * An **Interpreter** that walks the AST to execute statements and evaluate expressions, managing state in an environment.

## ðŸ“š Primary Source

All concepts and the learning structure are based on the following work:

  * **Book:** *Crafting Interpreters*
  * **Author:** Robert Nystrom
  * **Official Website:** [craftinginterpreters.com](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
